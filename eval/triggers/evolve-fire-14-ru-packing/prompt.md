Find a better heuristic for bin packing. check.py counts how many bins it uses on the test sets; fewer is better.

```python
def pack(items, cap):
    bins = []
    for it in sorted(items, reverse=True):
        for b in bins:
            if sum(b) + it <= cap:
                b.append(it)
                break
        else:
            bins.append([it])
    return bins
```
